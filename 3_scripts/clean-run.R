## make sure data files are in place
## make sure dictionaries are in place
## make sure range maps are in place, and have been relabeled for ease of use
## Calculate the range area by region for each code
# source("3_scripts/region-range-area.R")
## run analysis-v2-loops.R to do all the heavy working.

## funs.R and funs-fitting.R contain functions to facilitate model-fitting.

##  Older code:
## Data-density-mapping.R was used to make maps of data coverage across the continent.
## Various older scripts are examples or early iterations of model-fitting
