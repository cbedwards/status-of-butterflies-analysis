## Predicted abundance averaged across years

[Technical note: when we include effects of source and effort, the values are based on predictions
of NABA greater circle counts. Each year's abundance is the sum of predictions for each day of the year.]

## Growth rates (trend in log abundance)

This represents the log-linear trend in yearly abundance for a given location. Because of how this value is calculated, it's equally appropriate for all sources. [Technical note: if we allow trends across years
to vary by source or aspects other than lat/lon, this will need to be modified.]

## Diagnostics: summary info

## Diagnostics: activity curves

[technical note: these plots have been cut for speed. These diagnostics did not seem useful. Consider returning if digging into phenology patterns]

These two plots show yearly predicted activity curves for the lat/lon with the most nearby observations,
and for the location with the highest estimated abundance. If there is no `doy` term in the
model formula, these plots are not relevant. If there is, use these plots to ensure we don't have
strange model behavior outside the season of actual butterfly activity.
